# What you will learn

-   How a function in R works
-   How to create your own functions
-   How to use loops to create functions


In Algebra II when we talked about a function we usually meant a relationship between 2 numbers a dependent variable and an independent variable and was written something like this:

$$f(x) = 3x-6$$ 
or

$$ f(x)=\sqrt{x} $$ 

But back when you were in elementary school you may have seen this type of function:

![Functions](functions.png)

They all do the same thing which is take an input and produce a unique output.


In R we are doing something similar but quite a bit different. Lets re-download the loan50.csv that we looked at in the fall.

https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=loan50

```{r}
loans <- read.csv("loan50.csv")
```

```{r}
head(loans)
```


Now use the three functions that you already know to find the length, sum, and mean of the annual income variable.

```{r}


```

How could we find the mean of the annual income variable without using the mean function? 
Try to do it now:
```{r}


```

####Creating Functions

Now we will create our own version of the average function. It is not a super useful function because R already has it built in (the mean function) but it will help us see how to create a function.

```{r}
example.average.function.1 <- function( vector.to.be.averaged){
  
  average <- sum(vector.to.be.averaged)/length(vector.to.be.averaged)
  
  return(average)
}
```

Now to use this function we have to give it as an argument the vector of numbers we wanted to be averaged.

```{r}
example.average.function.1(loans$annual_income)
```

We could also break up the function into a few steps which is sometimes easier to understand:

```{r}
example.average.function.2 <- function( vector.to.be.averaged){
  
  #rename vector.to.be.averaged to be vect 
  vect <- vector.to.be.averaged
  
  #take the sum
  sum.v <- sum(vect)
  
  #divide by length
  average <- sum.v/ length(vect)

  return (average)
}
```


```{r}
example.average.function.2(loans$annual_income)
```

**Your Turn:**
Write a function that takes a number as an argument and returns that number doubled. Then test your function by using it to double a number of your choice.

```{r}
#define the function
doubling.function <- function( input ){
  
  blah <- input*2 
  
  return(blah)
  
}
```

```{r}
#test the function by seeing if it will double the number 10
doubling.function(10)
doubling.function(loans$annual_income)
```


Now, lets break lots of Algebra II rules and create a function that has more than one input and does not have a unique output for each group of inputs. 

If you have a lively social life, you probably frequently encounter situations in which you need to roll dice of different sizes. For example you may want to roll a d8 and a d20 (die with 8 sides and die with 20 sides) but you forgot your d20 next to your all wood custom Settlers of Catan set in the game closet. This is not a problem as we can just create a function that rolls 2 dice.

Multi-sided dice rolling function:
```{r}
#arguments are number of sides on die 1 and number of sides on die 2
dice.roller <- function(die1sides, die2sides ){ 

#pick 1 random number between 1 and the number of sides on the die and store it, once for each die
  d1 <- sample( 1:die1sides, 1)
  d2 <- sample( 1:die2sides, 1)

#Display results  
  return( c(d1, d2) )
}
```

```{r}
dice.roller(8, 20)
```
**Your turn:**

Use the dice.roller function to roll two 6-sided dies.

```{r}

```

Functions can be used to make certain tasks simpler. I like using R's built-in summary function to find the 5 number summary of a vector. Unfortunately the summary function also includes the mean as well as the annoying titles. 

```{r}
summary(loans$annual_income)
```

If I just want the 5 number summary, I can write a function that asks for 2 arguments, a vector of numbers and a logical that lets the function know if I want headers (TRUE) or no headers (FALSE). 

```{r}
new.5.num <- function( vector, labels ){
  
  numbers <- quantile(vector, c(0,.25, .5, .75, 1) )
  
  if (labels == FALSE){ numbers <- as.numeric(numbers) }
  
  numbers
}
```

Now we can run it with the headers.
```{r}
new.5.num(loans$annual_income, TRUE)
```

Here we can run it without the headers.
```{r}
new.5.num(loans$annual_income, FALSE)
```

####Default Arguments

Here is the same function but we add a default value for the second argument. That way if we leave the second argument blank, there is no error and R assumes that we did not want headers.
```{r}
new.5.num.default <- function( vector, labels = F ){
  
  numbers <- quantile(vector, c(0,.25, .5, .75, 1) )
  
  if (labels == FALSE){ numbers <- as.numeric(numbers) }
  
  numbers
}
```

```{r}
new.5.num.default(loans$annual_income )
```

**Your turn:**
Create a function called `multiplier()` that takes an input value x and an optional multiplier value k, and returns the product of x times k.

If no value for k is specified, have the function  use a default value of 2 for k.

Then test your function with both the default and another value of k.

```{r}


```

```{r}
multiplier(10)

multiplier(10, k = 3)
```


##Your Turn

1. Write a function that rolls two dice where the user can specify how many sides each die has, and returns the sum of the rolls. Make it so that the default is that the function rolls two 6-sided dice.

```{r}
#arguments are number of sides on die 1 and number of sides on die 2
dice.roller.1 <- function(die1sides=6, die2sides=6 ){ 

#pick 1 random number between 1 and the number of sides on the die and store it, once for each die
  d1 <- sample( 1:die1sides, 1)
  d2 <- sample( 1:die2sides, 1)

#sum the dice
  sum.of.dice <- d1 + d2
  
#Display results  
  return( sum.of.dice )
}

```


```{r}
dice.roller.1()
```




```{r}
#arguments are number of sides on die 1 and number of sides on die 2
dice.roller2 <- function(die1sides=6, die2sides=6){ 

#pick 1 random number between 1 and the number of sides on the die and store it, once for each die
  d1 <- sample( 1:die1sides, 1)
  d2 <- sample( 1:die2sides, 1)

#Sum Die
  sum.die <- d1 + d2
 
#Display results  
  return( sum.die )
}
```


```{r}
dice.roller2( 30, 100)
dice.roller2()
```


2a. In baseball, a batting average is calculated by taking a player's number of hits and dividing it by that player's number of at-bats. Write a function that takes two arguments, the number of at-bats and the number of hits, and returns a value representing the player's batting average.

```{r}
batting.avg <- function(hits, ab){
  
  ba <- hits/ab
  
  return(ba)
  
}

```





2b. Use your function from 2a. to calculate the batting average of baseball player Ted Williams, who had 7706 at bats and 2654 hits.
```{r}
batting.avg(2654, 7706)
```



2c. Read in ```terrible team.csv``` and use your batting average function with the columns AB and H. Your output should be the same as that in column BA except for rounding.

```{r}
Orioles <- read.csv("terrible team.csv")
head(Orioles)
batting.avg(Orioles$H, Orioles$AB)
```



3a. Create a function that finds the range of a vector of values. Note that in R there is a function called "range" that does not find the range, it returns the max and min values. We want our function to return the actual range (The range is the difference between the max and the min). Name your function "rng.fun".





```{r}
rng.fun <- function( my.vector ){
  
  max <- max(my.vector)
  min <- min(my.vector)
  my.range <- max-min

  return( my.range)
  
}

```


3b. Test your range function on the hits vector (H) of the terrible team data.


```{r}
rng.fun(Orioles$H)
```

```{r}
Orioles$H
```



4a. Write a function that takes 3 numeric values `a`, `b`, `c` and returns the real zeros of the quadratic:
$$
f(x)\ =\ a x^2 + b x + c
$$


```{r}
quad.form <- function( a, b, c){
  
  quad.pos <- (-b + sqrt( (b^2)-4*a*c ) )/ (2*a)
  
  quad.neg <-  (-b - sqrt( (b^2)-4*a*c ) )/ (2*a)
  
  return( c(quad.pos, quad.neg))
  
}
```


```{r}
quad.form(1,10,25)
quad.form(4,20,24)
```

4b. Test your quadratic function by using it to evaluate the functions y = x^2 + 10x + 25 and y = 4x^2 + 20x + 24 .
